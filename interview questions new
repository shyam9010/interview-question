11.Test classes, best practices, when we use best start test and stop test.
  ans. Test class must start with @isTest annotation.
       Focus 90+ : code coverage 
       Governor limits : Using Test.startTest()gives developers a new set of governor limits for the act stage of their test. 
       Test.stopTest() then allows them to return to their previous governor limits. Test classes must test for Governor Limits using Limits Class
       Create TestFactory class with @isTest annotation to exclude from organization code size limit.
       @testSetup to create test records once in a method and use in every test method in the test class.

12.What is @testsetup ?

13. Batch classes - diff between synchronous and asynchronous programming in apex?
  ANS. The Batch class is used to process millions of records within normal processing limits. With Batch Apex,
       we can process records asynchronously to stay within platform limits. If you have a lot of records to process, 
       for example, data cleansing or archiving, Batch Apex is probably your best solution.
      Synchronous Apex means entire Apex code is executed in one single go.
      Asynchronous term means not existing or occurring at the same time. 
      Asynchronous apex is executed when resources are available. So any calling method which calls Asynchronous apex wont wait for outcome of Asynchronous call.

14. Least, default, maximum batch size ?
  ANS. The minimum size for Batch Apex is 1. 
       The maximum size for Batch Apex is 2000. 
       The default is 200
